First repository to learn Github

I am learning how to use Github. Also learning how to program with Python and Pandas.
Ok back again to try it one more time as I was taken away from the computer yesterday mid-stream.

One more time.  Just to cement the process and check out all of the little buttons.

See, I was right.  My last attempt I forgot to create a branch first so I only edited the README file alone.

Got it.  Create branch, choose file, click edit pencil, edit file, make a commit note, click commit, create new pull request, title the pull request, merge pull request and confirm.
